/**
 * Object to hold information and value for an individual bean property.
 * Using an object here, rather than just storing all properties in
 * a map keyed by property name, allows for more flexibility, and the
 * ability to handle indexed properties etc in an optimized way.
 *
 * <p>Note that the value doesn't need to be the final required type:
 * A {@link BeanWrapper} implementation should handle any necessary conversion,
 * as this object doesn't know anything about the objects it will be applied to.
